## The Challenging Bot Project! What is this about? 
- The challenging bot is an open source robotic test-bed in the field of artificial motion learning. It was developed in the Embedded Mechatronics Laboratory (EML) at University of Applied Science in Karlsruhe.
- It is designed in a low-cost (roughly 1500â‚¬), easy-to-use and easy-to-build manner and published for research and engineering teams around the world to use. 
- For further information, read this paper ---> LINK TO PAPER
- This website hosts full explanation of the dynamic modelling, the mechatronic design, feedback control, motion planning via RRT as well as motion learning via ILC.
- The project's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alessandro-papa/challanging_bot.git) contains all necessary files and documents.
  - A simulation workspace to set up and simulate mentioned methods
  - CAD files of the mechanical parts
  - Wiring schematics and PCBs
  - List of components
