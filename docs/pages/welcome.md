## The Challenging Bot Project! What is this about? 
- The challenging bot is an open source robotic test-bed in the field of artificial motion learning. It was developed in the Embedded Mechatronics Laboratory (EML) at University of Applied Science in Karlsruhe.
- It is designed in a low-cost (roughly 1500€), easy-to-use and easy-to-build manner and published for research and engineering teams around the world to use. 
- For further information, read this paper ---> LINK TO PAPER
- This website hosts full explanation of the dynamic modelling, the mechatronic design, feedback control, motion planning via RRT as well as motion learning via ILC.
- The project's GitHub Repository contains all necessary files and documents.
- A simulation workspace to set up and simulate mentioned methods
- Furthermore, all files are contained
- all files attached!
  - CAD files, EAGLE files, list of components
